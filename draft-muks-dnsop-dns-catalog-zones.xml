      <t>This document describes a method for automatic zone catalog
      provisioning and synchronization among DNS master and slave
      nameservers by storing and transferring the catalogs as regular

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>DNS nameservers implement AXFR and IXFR for zone data
      synchronization among a master and its slaves, but the list of
      zones served (called a catalog in <xref target="RFC1035" />) is
      not automatically synchronized. The administrator of a DNS
      nameserver farm has to manually, or via an external application
      layer, synchronize such zone catalogs among masters and their
      slaves. This can be inconvenient, error-prone and dependent on the
      nameserver implementation.</t>

      <t>A method for automatic zone catalog provisioning and
      synchronization is useful, so that the zone catalog can be
      maintained in one master location by an administrator, similar to
      zone data.</t>

      <t>This document describes one such method, in which the catalog
      is represented as a regular DNS zone called a "catalog zone", and
      transferred using zone transfers. The representation of catalogs
      within DNS zones is specified and nameserver requirements are
      listed so that DNS implementations can support catalog zones.</t>

      <t>The contents and representation of catalog zones are described
      under <xref target="sec-catzones" />. Nameserver behavior is
      described in <xref target="sec-impl" />. A glossary of some terms
      used in this memo is provided in <xref target="sec-glossary"
      />.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"

      target="RFC2119" />.</t>

    <section title="Catalog zones" anchor="sec-catzones">
      <section title="Description">
	<t>A catalog zone is a specially crafted DNS zone that contains,
	as DNS zone data, a list of DNS zones called member zones and
	associated template zone configuration common to all its member
	zones. An implementation of catalog zones MAY allow catalog
	zones to include other catalog zones, but template zone
	configuration present in a catalog zone only applies to its
	immediate member zones. A catalog zone is meant to be used to
	provision DNS catalogs to nameservers via zone transfers, for
	the purpose of setting up member zones to be served from these
	nameservers.</t>

	<t>[TBD/FIXME] A catalog zone overrides the meanings of various
	RR types to achieve its purpose. Though this may be
	controversial, the situation is not different from other similar
	zone-based representations such as response-policy zones <xref
	target="RPZ" />. Other than being transmitted via zone
	transfers, catalog zones are not directly visible in the DNS and
	are not intended to be served via DNS QUERY <xref
	target="RFC1035" />.</t>

	<t>Member zones' configuration is specified as a list of zone
	properties. Each zone property has a name and an associated
	value of a specific data type. Zone property value data types
	are described in <xref target="sec-types" />. Zone property
	names are case-insensitive. Each zone property uses one data
	type only for its values. A list of permitted zone property
	names and their data types is given in <xref
	target="sec-properties" />.</t>

	<t>TBD: Transitive catalogs</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Resource record fields">
	<t>A catalog zone contains various resource records (RRs). They
	have NAME, TYPE, CLASS, TTL, RDLENGTH and RDATA as fields <xref
	target="RFC1035" />.</t>

	<t>The NAME field contains the owner name of the respective
	RR. As with all DNS zones, the owner name must be a child of the
	catalog zone name.</t>

	<t>The TYPE field depends on the type of catalog zone property
	value being represented. <xref target="sec-types" /> describes
	how various zone property value types are represented.</t>

	<t>[TBD/FIXME] The CLASS field of the RR MUST be set to the
	value 1 (IN) <xref target="RFC1035" />. This is because RR types
	such as SRV and APL (which catalog zones overloads the meaning
	of) are defined only for the IN class. </t>

	<t>The TTL field is not used as these RRs are not intended to be
	served via DNS QUERY. It SHOULD be set to 1.</t>

	<t>The RDLENGTH field contains the length of the RDATA field.</t>

	<t>The content of the RDATA field depends on the type of catalog
	zone property value being represented. <xref target="sec-types"
	/> describes how various zone property value types are
	represented.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="SOA and NS records at apex">
	<t>Similar to any other DNS zone, a catalog zone would be
	expected to have a syntactically correct SOA record and one or
	more NS records at its apex.</t>

	<t>The SOA record's SERIAL, REFRESH, RETRY and EXPIRE fields
	<xref target="RFC1035" /> are used during zone transfer. A
	catalog zone's SOA SERIAL field MUST increase when an update is
	made to the catalog zone's contents. Otherwise, slave
	nameservers may not notice updates to the catalog zone's
	contents.</t>
	
	<t>The SOA record's MINIMUM field <xref target="RFC1035" /> is
	not applicable to catalog zones, as they are not intended to be
	served via DNS QUERY. It SHOULD be set to 1 in all catalog
	zones. [TBD/FIXME] Master and slave nameservers MUST NOT use
	catalog zones with an unexpected value in the SOA MINIMUM field
	as catalog zones, but they may be transferred.</t>

	<t>As catalog zones are not intended to be part of the DNS, NS
	records at the apex are not used but they are still required so
	that catalog zones are syntactically correct DNS zones. No
	parent delegation for the catalog zone is required. Any valid
	DNS name can be used in the NSDNAME field of such NS records
	<xref target="RFC1035" /> and they will be ignored. A single NS
	RR with an NSDNAME field containing the absolute name "invalid."
	is recommended <xref target="RFC2606" />.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Zone property value data types" anchor="sec-types">
	<section title="String" anchor="sec-string">
	  <t>A property with a string as value is specified using a TXT
	  RR <xref target="RFC1035" /> with owner name set to the name
	  of the property as a sub-domain of the catalog zone name, and
	  RDATA set to the property value.</t>

	  <t>For example, if a catalog zone is named
	  "catalog1.example.org." and contains a property "prop0" with
	  string value "Example", the corresponding RR may look as
	  follows:</t>

	  <figure>
	    <artwork>
	prop0.catalog1.example.org. 3600 IN TXT "Example"
	    </artwork>
	  </figure>

	  <t>Here, "prop0" can only contain one string, though it may
	  consist of multiple &lt;character-string&gt;s <xref
	  target="RFC1035" />.</t>
	</section>

	<section title="Single name" anchor="sec-sname">
	  <t>A property with a single name as value is specified using a
	  CNAME RR <xref target="RFC1035" /> with owner name set to the
	  name of the property as a sub-domain of the catalog zone name,
	  and RDATA set to the property value.</t>
	  
	  <t>For example, if a catalog zone is named
	  "catalog1.example.org." and contains a property "prop1" with
	  value "val1.example.com.", the corresponding RR may look as
	  follows:</t>
	  
	  <figure>
	    <artwork>
	prop1.catalog1.example.org. 3600 IN CNAME val1.example.com.
	    </artwork>
	  </figure>

	  <t>Here, "prop1" can only contain one name. It cannot be a
	  list of names. It is restricted by the use of the CNAME RR
	  type.</t>
	</section>

	<section title="Unordered list of names" anchor="sec-unolist">
	  <t>Let N be an absolute name formed by concatenating the RDATA
	  hash (see <xref target="sec-glossary" />), the name of the
	  property, and the catalog zone name in that order, such that N
	  is a unique owner name in the catalog zone.</t>
	  
	  <t>Then, a property containing an unordered list of names as
	  value is specified using multiple PTR RRs <xref
	  target="RFC1035" /> with owner name set to N, and each RR's
	  RDATA set to each name in the list of the property's value
	  respectively.</t>
	  
	  <t>For example, if a catalog zone is named
	  "catalog1.example.org." and contains a property "prop2" with
	  its value being an unordered list of two names
	  "a.example.com." and "b.example.com.", the corresponding RRs
	  may look as follows:</t>
	  
	  <figure>
	    <artwork>
	&lt;hash&gt;.prop2.catalog1.example.org. 3600 IN PTR a.example.com.
	&lt;hash&gt;.prop2.catalog1.example.org. 3600 IN PTR b.example.com.
	    </artwork>
	  </figure>

	  <t>Here, the property "prop2" can contain one or more names as
	  its value but they are not ordered.</t>
	</section>

	<section title="Ordered list of names" anchor="sec-olist">
	  <t>Let N be an absolute name formed by concatenating the RDATA
	  hash (see <xref target="sec-glossary" />), the name of the
	  property, and the catalog zone name in that order, such that N
	  is a unique owner name in the catalog zone.</t>
	  
	  <t>Then, a property containing an ordered list of names as
	  value is specified using multiple SRV RRs <xref
	  target="RFC2782" /> with owner name set to N. The RDATA of
	  each SRV RR contains the Priority, Weight, Port and Target
	  fields. Over multiple SRV RRs, the Target field should be set
	  to each name in the list of the property's value
	  respectively. The &lt;Priority, Weight, Port&gt; fields in
	  that sequence form a sort ordering tuple, and their values
	  should be set to numbers that represents this name's relative
	  order (in ascending order) in the ordered list of names. As
	  Priority, Weight and Port are 16-bit fields, it's possible to
	  order 1&lt;&lt;48 different names within a single zone
	  property value. It is advised to separate the sort ordering
	  tuple values sufficiently with gaps so that list items can be
	  introduced in-between without significant change to the
	  existing records' sort ordering tuple values.</t>
	  
	  <t>For example, if a catalog zone is named "cat1.example.org."
	  and contains a property "prop3" with its value being an
	  ordered list of three names "n1.example.com.",
	  "n2.example.com." and "n3.example.com." in that order, the
	  corresponding RRs may look as follows:</t>
	  
	  <figure>
	    <artwork>
	&lt;hash&gt;.prop3.cat1.example.org. 3600 IN SRV 0 0 100 n1.example.com.
	&lt;hash&gt;.prop3.cat1.example.org. 3600 IN SRV 0 0 200 n2.example.com.
	&lt;hash&gt;.prop3.cat1.example.org. 3600 IN SRV 0 0 300 n3.example.com.
	    </artwork>
	  </figure>

	  <t>Here, the property "prop3" can contain one or more names as
	  its value and they are ordered.</t>
	</section>

	<section title="Unordered list of networks of addresses" anchor="sec-network">
	  <t>Let N be an absolute name formed by concatenating the RDATA
	  hash (see <xref target="sec-glossary" />), the name of the
	  property, and the catalog zone name in that order, such that N
	  is a unique owner name in the catalog zone.</t>

	  <t>Then, a property containing an unordered list of networks
	  of addresses as value is specified using multiple MX RRs <xref
	  target="RFC1035" /> with owner name set to N, and each RR's
	  RDATA set to a representation for each address in the list of
	  the property's value respectively, as given below.</t>

	  <t>The RDATA of an MX RR contains the PREFERENCE and EXCHANGE
	  fields. The PREFERENCE field should be set to the prefix
	  length (left-most significant bits) of the network address and
	  the EXCHANGE field should be set to a DNS name in either
	  IN-ADDR.ARPA (<xref target="RFC0883" /> and <xref
	  target="RFC0973" />) or IP6.ARPA (<xref target="RFC3596" />)
	  representation.</t>

	  <t>For example, if a catalog zone is named "c1.example.org."
	  and contains a property "prop" with value as network addresses
	  [10.98.192.0/255.255.255.0] and [10.98.193.40/32], the
	  corresponding RRs may look as follows:</t>

	  <figure>
	    <artwork>
	&lt;hash&gt;.prop.c1.example.org. 3600 IN MX 24 0.192.98.10.in-addr.arpa.
	&lt;hash&gt;.prop.c1.example.org. 3600 IN MX 32 40.193.98.10.in-addr.arpa.
	    </artwork>
	  </figure>

	  <t>Here, the property "prop" can contain one or more networks
	  of addresses as its value but they are not ordered.</t>
	</section>

	<section title="Single host address">
	  <t>A single host address is represented using the unordered
	  list of networks of addresses data type (see <xref
	  target="sec-network" />) with a suitable network mask to
	  result in a single network address.</t>
	</section>

        <section title="Comment">
          <t>Comments may be added anywhere in a catalog zone using a
          scheme such as NOTE RRs <xref target="I-D.hunt-note-rr"
          />. This memo does not depend on NOTE RRs and it is only
          suggested here as an informative reference.</t>
        </section>

	<section title="Zone properties specific to a member zone">
	  <t>Member zones in a catalog zone share template zone
	  configuration that is common to all member zones in that
	  catalog. This section describes the syntax that can be used to
	  specify zone properties specific to single member zones.</t>

	  <t>Let N be an absolute name formed by concatenating the
	  member zone name hash (see <xref target="sec-glossary" />) and
	  the catalog zone name in that order, such that N is a unique
	  owner name in the catalog zone.</t>

	  <t>Zone properties specific to a particular member zone are
	  specified under the respective sub-domain N.</t>

	  <t>For example, if a catalog zone is named
	  "catalog1.example.org." and a member zone "example.com."
	  contains a property "prop0" with string (see <xref
	  target="sec-string" />) value "Example", the corresponding RR
	  may look as follows:</t>

	  <figure>
	    <artwork>
	prop0.&lt;m-hash&gt;.catalog1.example.org. 3600 IN TXT "Example"
	    </artwork>
	  </figure>

	  <t>As another example, if a catalog zone is named
	  "cat1.example.org." and a member zone "example.com."  contains
	  a property "prop2" with its value being an unordered list (see
	  <xref target="sec-unolist" />) of two names "a.example.com."
	  and "b.example.com.", the corresponding RRs may look as
	  follows:</t>

    <section title="Nameserver behavior and requirements" anchor="sec-impl">
      <t>TBD: Explain nameserver behavior briefly here.</t>

      <t>As it is a regular DNS zone, a catalog zone can be transferred
      using DNS zone transfers among nameservers. Catalog zones are not
      part of the DNS, so they are not intended to be served via DNS
      QUERY. [TBD/FIXME] Nameserver software may start additional
      section processing for various RR types if they are queried. It
      may also be inconvenient to serve some contents of catalog zones
      via DNS queries anyway due to the nature of their
      representation. A separate method of querying entries inside the
      catalog zone may be made available by nameserver
      implementations.</t>
      
      <t>Catalog updates should be automatic, i.e., when a nameserver
      that supports catalog zones completes a zone transfer for a
      catalog zone, it SHOULD apply changes to the catalog within the
      running nameserver automatically without any manual
      intervention.</t>
      
      <t>As with regular zones, master and slave nameservers for a
      catalog zone may be operated by different administrators. The
      slave nameservers may be configured to synchronize catalog zones
      from the master, but the master's administrators may not have
      any administrative access to the slaves.</t>
      
      <t>A catalog zone can be updated via DNS UPDATE on a master, or
      via zone transfers. Nameservers MAY allow broken zones with
      incorrect catalog zone syntax (as they are treated as regular
      zones), but nameservers MUST NOT process such broken zones as
      catalog zones. For the purpose of catalog processing, the broken
      catalogs MUST be ignored.</t>

      <t>If there is a clash between an existing member zone's name and
      an incoming member zone's name (via transfer or update), the new
      instance of the zone MUST be ignored and an error SHOULD be
      logged.</t>
      
      <t>When zones are introduced into a catalog zone, a master MUST
      first make the new zones available for transfers before making the
      updated catalog zone available for transfer, or sending NOTIFY for
      the catalog zone to slaves. Note that slaves may attempt to
      transfer the catalog zone upon refresh timeout, so care must be
      taken to make the member zones available before any update is
      visible in the catalog zone.</t>

      <t>When zones are deleted from a catalog zone, a master MAY delete
      the member zone immediately after notifying slaves. It is up to
      the slave nameserver to handle this scenario correctly.</t>
      
      <t>TBD: Transitive master-slave relationships</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section title="Security considerations">
      <t>As catalog zones are transmitted using DNS zone transfers, it
      is absolutely essential for these transfers to be protected from
      unexpected modifications on the route. So, it is a requirement
      that catalog zone transfers MUST be authenticated using TSIG <xref
      target="RFC2845" />. A master MUST NOT serve a catalog zone for
      transfer without using TSIG and a slave MUST abandon an update to
      a catalog zone that was received without using TSIG.</t>

      <t>DNS UPDATE <xref target="RFC2136" /> to catalog zones similarly
      MUST be authenticated using TSIG.</t>

      <t>Zone transfers of member zones MUST similarly be authenticated
      using TSIG <xref target="RFC2845" />. The TSIG shared secrets used
      for member zones are identical to those used for the catalog
      zones. Details of the shared secrets MUST NOT be mentioned
      anywhere in the catalog zone data.</t>

      <t>Catalog zones do not need to be signed using DNSSEC. Their zone
      transfers are authenticated by TSIG. Signed zones MUST be handled
      normally by nameservers, and their contents MUST NOT be
      DNSSEC-validated.</t>

      <t>Catalog zones originated as the chosen method among various

      chosen method of storing the catalog as a regular DNS zone was
      proposed by Stephen Morris.</t>
      
      <t>We later discovered that Paul Vixie's earlier <xref

      reviewed it. Catalog zones borrows some syntax ideas from
      Metazones, as both share this scheme of representing the catalog

	<t>Config options
	<vspace blankLines="1"/>
	We want catalog zones to be adopted by multiple DNS
	implementations. Towards this, we have to generalize zone
	config options and adopt a minimal set that we can expect
	most implementations to support.
	</t>
	<t>Catalog zone and member zones on different masters
	<vspace blankLines="1"/>
	Will it be possible to setup a catalog zone on one
	nameserver as master, and allow its member zones to be
	served by different master namesservers?
	</t>
	<t>Transitive relationships
	<vspace blankLines="1"/>
	For a catalog zone, a slave may be a master to a different
	nameservers in a nameserver farm. In these transitive
	relationships, zone configuration options (such as
	also-notify and allow-transfer) may differ based on the
	location of the master in the hierarchy. It may not be
	possible to specify this within a catalog zone.
	</t>
	<t>Templates
	<vspace blankLines="1"/>
	Are support for config and zone data templates useful at
	this level? They would add complexity across
	implementations. If added, it would be better to restrict
	templates at the master and let the slave receive regular
	expanded zones.
	</t>
	<t>Overriding controls
	<vspace blankLines="1"/>
	A way to override zone config options (as prescribed by the
	catalog zones) on slaves was requested. As this would be
	configured outside catalog zones, it may be better to leave
	this to implementations.
	</t>
	<t>Choice of hash function
	<vspace blankLines="1"/>
	Should a different faster hash function be chosen to replace
	SHA-1 when computing catalog member zone name hashes?
	</t>
	<t>Allocation of custom RR types
	<vspace blankLines="1"/>
	It may be worth having broader discussion on whether we should
	get custom RR types for representing various zone property value
	data types.
