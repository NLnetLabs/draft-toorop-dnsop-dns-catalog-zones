% DNS Catalog Zones - About

DNS Catalog Zones is a method in which a catalog of zones is represented as a regular DNS zone, and transferred using DNS zone transfers. As zones are added to or removed from the catalog zone, the changes are propagated to the secondary nameservers in the normal way. The secondary nameservers then add/remove/modify the zones they serve in accordance with the changes to the zone.
