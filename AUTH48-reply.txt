The original is correct. The initials should be C.R.

I have gone through the rendered version carefully and added a few <tt>'s. They are in the attached xml file.

The order should remain as is, because the descriptions of the terms use the previously defined terms.

All our other sourcecode elements are also of type "dns-rr". The attached xml file has them updated with that type.

We don't take the suggestion but have updated the xml with: "Before the actual migration the consumer MUST verify that the coo property pointing to $NEWCATZ is still present in $OLDCATZ."

Is that also more clear in your opinion?

Whe adapted the xml with the following: The group value designated to indicate this combination of settings is pre-arranged with each operator  ("operator-x-foo" vs. "operator-y" "bar").

Is that better?

FYI - We modified your rearrangement a bit in the attached updated xml, to say: The zone and associated state (such as zone data and DNSSEC keys) MUST be removed from the consumer when and only when the zone was configured initially from the same catalog.

FYI - we updated your readability update to the following in the attached xml: If in the process of a migration some consumers of the involved catalog zones did not catch the removal of the member zone from $OLDCATZ yet (because of a lost packet or downtime or otherwise) but already saw the update of $NEWCATZ containing the addition of that member zone, they may consider this update to be a name clash (see Section 5.2) and as a consequence the member is not migrated to $NEWCATZ.
